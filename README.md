# Peng

This is a project I made for my Web Frameworks and Advanced Techniques class at Humber College. It's my first React project made 100% by myself, without following tutorials. 

The assignment was to make a single page with a minimum of 4 components and be fully responsive. It was also required to use real content (not lorem ipsum) so I came out with a mug store. It's silly and it can't really work because I obviously couldn't implement a shopping system but it served its purpose.
